      I have worked hard to create numerous projects which are all different and
      show my skills as a self-taught Front-End Web Developer. I have learnt how
      to use API’s on my first projects where the user can find meals based on
      the ingredients they enter in the text box. The second project I was able
      to create an with a interactive feature button which shows the features of
      the mobile phone in a fun way, works on bigger screens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third project 'PS4' was a project where I really made my code more
      clean and readable. This website is fully responsive with no issues at
      all. The nav bar was made from scratch using simple clean code in JS. The
      forth was one of the most exciting projects I worked on as I was able to
      see how a form works and was very simple to do when you know how. Also
      works in bigger screens only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth project was my ‘Purple Calculator’, this project I used the most
      Javascript and understood the logic behind coding in more depth. The last
      project was one of the first projects I made which was a portfolio to be
      considered on a course, I learnt the fundamentals of HTML and CSS building
      this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last project was a Netfix Clone website, here I was able to develop my
      Javascript skills for example when you click on the tab icons a new
      section of the page will show.
